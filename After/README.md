# Project Refactoring Documentation

Firstly, I carefully reviewed the README.md file for a clear understanding of the what has been asked and what's purpose of this project. Then, my primary goal was to enhance the codebase's maintainability, readability, and scalability by applying the SOLID principles.

## Initial Review
The refactoring process began with a thorough review of the project's README.md file to gain a clear understanding of the project's purpose and functionality. This was followed by an in-depth analysis of the source code to comprehend its current flow and structure.

## Implementation of SOLID Principles
The SOLID principles were applied to the codebase to improve its design. This involved identifying areas where the code could be improved by separating concerns and responsibilities. The logic was extracted into separate classes to reduce coupling and ensure that each class only depends on the interfaces it uses. This approach enhances the code's modularity, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## Project Structure
To maintain a clean architecture and structure, the codebase was organized into different folders that represent various layers of the application. This structure makes it easier to locate specific pieces of code and understand their role within the overall application.

## Testing and Documentation
Unit tests were written using `XUnit` to verify the correctness of the refactored code. This ensures that the changes made during the refactoring process did not inadvertently introduce any bugs.
To improve the project's usability and accessibility, `Swagger` was used to document and expose the controllers. XML documentation was also added for all public classes and interfaces, providing users with clear and comprehensive information about the project's API.

## Future Improvements
While the refactoring process focused on improving the existing codebase's design and structure, it did not introduce any new features. Potential areas for future enhancement include implementing **caching** for improved performance, adding **security** measures to protect sensitive data, and incorporating **logging** to facilitate debugging and issue tracking. These features would further enhance the project's functionality and usability.

## Tip
For the first time running the project, you may need to update the package `Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform` to version **1.0.7** or **1.0.8**.
